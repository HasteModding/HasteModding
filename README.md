# HasteModding

This Github organisation exists to give mod developers a place to host the source code for their Haste: Broken Worlds mods, aswell as acting as a central source of information to help developers create mods, and help users use them

---

## Current state
As of writing, Landfall has yet to release the full Haste game. Until the game is released, this repo serves as a placeholder. Use of this repo can begin when the full game is released, to prevent redundant changes being made.

## Rules
1. Do not obfuscate any content. This applies to the code in it's source and compilled form.
2. Do not release malicious code. This applies to code intended to harm Landfall or any user's of mods.
3. Do not infringe copyright. You should respect both Landfall's and any other individuals copyright.
